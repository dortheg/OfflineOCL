 * \class FileReader
 * \brief Class for reading TDR buffers from file.
 * \details This class reads the TDR buffers from binary files. It removes all CFD values from the stream. It also decodes the binary format to
 * the WordBuffer type.
 * \author Vetle W. Ingeberg
 * \date 2015-2016

 * \todo It should be created an interface class for FileReader and then this class should inherit its functionality. This will make it easier to implement
 * support for other file formats other than the TDR format.
